'''
Abstract Factory Method is a Creational Design pattern that allows you to produce the families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes. 
Using the abstract factory method, we have the easiest ways to produce a similar type of many objects. 
It provides a way to encapsulate a group of individual factories. 
Basically, here we try to abstract the creation of the objects depending on the logic, 
business, platform choice, etc.
