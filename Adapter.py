'''Adapter method is a Structural Design Pattern which helps us in making the incompatible objects 
adaptable to each other. The Adapter method is one of the easiest methods to understand because 
we have a lot of real-life examples that show the analogy with it. The main purpose of this method 
is to create a bridge between two incompatible interfaces. This method provides a different interface 
for a class. We can more easily understand the concept by thinking about the Cable Adapter that 
allows us to charge a phone somewhere that has outlets in different shapes.
Using this idea, we can integrate the classes that couldnâ€™t be integrated due to 
interface incompatibility.'''
