# Multiprocessing Program to understand the concept of different processes running on same python script. 

# importing the multiprocessing module
import multiprocessing
import os

def worker1():
	# printing process id
	print("ID of process running worker1: {}".format(os.getpid()))

def worker2():
	# printing process id
	print("ID of process running worker2: {}".format(os.getpid()))

if __name__ == "__main__":
	# printing main program process id
	print("ID of main process: {}".format(os.getpid()))

	# creating processes
	p1 = multiprocessing.Process(target=worker1)
	p2 = multiprocessing.Process(target=worker2)

	# starting processes
	p1.start()
	p2.start()

	# process IDs
	print("ID of process p1: {}".format(p1.pid))
	print("ID of process p2: {}".format(p2.pid))

	# wait until processes are finished
	p1.join()
	p2.join()

	# both processes finished
	print("Both processes finished execution!")

	# check if processes are alive
	print("Process p1 is alive: {}".format(p1.is_alive()))
	print("Process p2 is alive: {}".format(p2.is_alive()))

    # Output :
    #ID of main process: 28628
    #ID of process running worker1: 29305
    #ID of process running worker2: 29306
    #ID of process p1: 29305
    #ID of process p2: 29306
    #Both processes finished execution!
    #Process p1 is alive: False
    #Process p2 is alive: False

    #Code Explanation :
    # The main python script has a different process ID and multiprocessing module spawns new processes 
    # with different process IDs as we create Process objects p1 and p2. In above program, 
    # we use os.getpid() function to get ID of process running the current target function.
    # Notice that it matches with the process IDs of p1 and p2 which we obtain 
    # using pid attribute of Process class. 

    # Each process runs independently and has its own memory space.

    # As soon as the execution of target function is finished, the processes get terminated. 
    # In above program we used is_alive method of Process class to check if a process is still active or not.
