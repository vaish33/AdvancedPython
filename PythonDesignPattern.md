#### Design Pattern :

    The design pattern is a technique which used by the developer to solve the commonly occurring software design. In simple word, it is a predefine pattern to solve a recurring problem in the code. These patterns are mainly designed based on requirements analysis.

    For Example, An algorithm is like a cooking recipe: we have a clear set of ingredients (or set of solutions) to cook something (problems or goals). On the other side, a pattern is like a blueprint: we can see what the result and its features are, but we can modify the order of implementation.
